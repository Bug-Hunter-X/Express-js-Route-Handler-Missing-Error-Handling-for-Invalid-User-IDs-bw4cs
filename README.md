# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input, specifically when dealing with numeric parameters like user IDs.

The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code, which attempts to access a user based on an ID received in the URL parameters.  It lacks checks for cases where the ID is not a valid integer, which can lead to unexpected behavior (e.g., a server crash due to `parseInt` failing) or incorrect results.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version with proper error handling in place to address these issues. It demonstrates the importance of validating user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities and unexpected errors.
